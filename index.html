<p>We are the Gwa'sala and the 'Nakwaxda'xw peoples who have strong cultual and family ties. In the 1964 we were focibly relocated to a small community. Our population is about 1100, with about 56% of members living as on-reserve community members. The Tsulquate Reserve where most of us live, is adjacent to the town of Port Hardy on the North-eastern tip of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We are considered part of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nations, stretching from the Campbell River area to Smith Inlet. The Gwa'sala and 'Nakwaxda'xw have our own language dialects: Gwa'cala and 'Na'kwala. These dialects are also referred to as Bak̓wa̱mk̓ala. Before we were relocated in 1964, we lived as two separate tribes. The Gwa'sala people mostly lived and traveled around Smith Inlet and the surrounding islands. The 'Nakwaxda'xw people were in Seymour Inlet, the Deserters's Group, Blunden Harbour, and surroiunding islands. While many of our practices were similar, we spoke different dialects and each tribe had our own distinct culture.</p>
