  <h1>About Me</h1>
<section>
    <p>I am Kelly Anderson, I am 23 years old. I come from the <strong>Gwa'sala nation</strong> <em>(Smith Inlet)</em>on my fathers side and <strong>Heiltsuk Nation</strong> <em>(Bella Balla)</em> on my mothers side. I live in Port Hardy B.C on the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw reserve called Tsulquate. For the past 2 years, I've been working with the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Language Program as a Local Research Lead. We are also working with First Voices to get our Bak̓wa̱mk̓ala Language on First Voice, so our people can learn our language.</p>
