  <p>We are the Gwa'sala and the 'Nakwaxda'xw peoples who have strong cultual and family ties. In the 1964 we were focibly relocated to a small community. Our population is about 1100, with about 56% of members living as on-reserve community members. The Tsulquate Reserve where most of us live, is adjacent to the town of Port Hardy on the North-eastern tip of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We are considered part of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nations, stretching from the Campbell River area to Smith Inlet. The Gwa'sala and 'Nakwaxda'xw have our own language dialects: Gwa'cala and 'Na'kwala. These dialects are also referred to as Bak̓wa̱mk̓ala. Before we were relocated in 1964, we lived as two separate tribes. The Gwa'sala people mostly lived and traveled around Smith Inlet and the surrounding islands. The 'Nakwaxda'xw people were in Seymour Inlet, the Deserters's Group, Blunden Harbour, and surroiunding islands. While many of our practices were similar, we spoke different dialects and each tribe had our own distinct culture.</p>

  <h1>Our vision</h1>
  <!-- life before being forced to move -->
  <p>Before moving to Tsulquate the 'Nakwaxda'xw and Gwa'sala we lived by harvesting sea food and land resources an were socially, politically, economically and culturally involved with other bands in the region through trade in goods and labour, inter-marriage and involementin potlatches. Like other coastal and interior bands, the 'Nakwaxda'xw and Gwa'sala participated as trappers in the European fur trade. in the 1960s the Canadian federal government stepped up it's activities in the field of indigenous administrationand verious "solutions"were being investigated. In 1964 after the fishing season was over, almost all the people moved to the Tsulquate Reserve, Tsulquate was not meant to have the whole village of houses built on it. It was just a campground the Kwakitl people from Fort Rupert used when they wanted to dig clams. <strong>Our dreams for the future</strong>, We will be a community with a strong and distinct culture, where our language, traditions, and the teachings of our ancestors live on throughout the generations. We will continue to be care takers of our sacred and important places. We will gather often and support eachother.</p>
